# General-Puropse-Console-Appliation
A short and sweet General Perpouse Kinda stupid Console Application written in C#


## Setup
- First open the `Program.cs` file and go to the feild of `var person = "TestBot";` and in the place of TestBot enter in your name...
- Right under that line in the if statement: `if (userid == "Test")` In the feild of Test enter in a username...
- Below inside a while loop is an if statement inside which you can see: `if (password == "abc123")` Change the abc123 with your password...

In theory you should be all setup and ready to go!

# Thanks!
